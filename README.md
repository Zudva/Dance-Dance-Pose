Dance Dance Pose puts your singing and dancing skills to the test by utilizing motion capture and pitch detection inspired by popular games such as Dance Dance Revolution and Rockband. Users must sing on key and dance to their favorite songs in order to earn points. Utilizing both web audio detection and pose detection through Posenet by Tensorflow, the game allows users to experience their favorite songs in an entirely new format.
